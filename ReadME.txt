Project: Cannabis Sobriety Test

Impaired driving kills 100s of Canadians every year. The band-aid style legalization of cannabis in recent years, combined with the strong prohibition of use in research laboratories for decades prior, has left the justice system misaligned with physiological realities.In this project our goal is to detect unsual brain activity that might otherwise not be present in a person who is not intoxicated with cannabis.

We intend on doing this in the following ways:
- train your ML model using data for normal brain activity.
- train it using data for the brain activity when a person is under the influence of cannabis.
- we then plan to compare these two and observe a pattern which could signal the use of cannabis.
- Use our model to detect cannabis using a BCI hardware kit.
